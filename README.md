## Notes
1. The codes are written in Java using IntelliJ. I am unaware if other IDEs (ie. Eclipse) can open this project properly.
2. Currently the test is failing due to Google detecting that a machine is controlling the process hence a captcha is thrown. The assertion is still there which assumes the changes go through.

## How to run:
1. If you use IntelliJ, you can simply navigate to `src/test/java/testcases` and open the `GoogleSearchTest.java` file.
2. Run the test by clicking the UI button or hitting `CTRL + SHIFT + F10`
